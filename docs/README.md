# Docs Directory

This directory contains the legacy **Prompt Builder** tool frontend.

The primary documentation site mapping is handled by MkDocs from the `docs_src/` directory, outputting to `_site/`.

## Prompt Builder

The `index.html` file in this directory serves a browser-based tool to interactively guide you through the 5 prompt components.
