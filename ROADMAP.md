This roadmap documents planned features, updates, and upcoming modules for the Prompt Engineering Playbook.

## Q2 2026 - Q3 2026

- ✅ **Module 6 Release:** Agentic Patterns & Tool Use
- 🔄 **Advanced Evaluation Frameworks:** Expanding `evaluation-template.md` to support deep multi-agent workflow testing.
- 🔜 **New Stack Support:** Provide base instructions and prompt setups for Go and Rust.
- 🔜 **Automated Context Fetching (RAG):** Better built-in Copilot rules to automatically enforce context retrieval for large mono-repos.

## Future Plans

- Interactive VS Code Extension integration for template scaffolding.
- Full `dspy` integration examples for Python stacks.
- More comparative papers on long-context vs RAG scaling.

> **Note:** Prioritization is fluid and subject to community feedback.
