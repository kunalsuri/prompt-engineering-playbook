# `.github/prompts/`

This directory is where VS Code looks for Copilot prompt files in your project. In this repository, the source prompt templates live in [`prompts/`](../../prompts/) — organized by technology stack.

To use prompts in your own project, copy the relevant `.prompt.md` files from `prompts/<your-stack>/prompts/` into your project's `.github/prompts/` directory. See [GETTING-STARTED.md](../../GETTING-STARTED.md) for step-by-step instructions.
