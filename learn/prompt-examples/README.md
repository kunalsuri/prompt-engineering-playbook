# Prompt Examples

This directory contains worked prompt examples demonstrating the patterns taught in the [curriculum modules](../README.md). Each file shows prompts applied to a specific LLM or use case, with before/after comparisons illustrating the effect of prompt-engineering techniques.

## Available Examples

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Prompt Patterns in Practice](prompt-patterns-in-practice.md) | Side-by-side examples of all six patterns from Module 3, applied to real coding tasks |
| [Advanced Patterns in Practice](advanced-patterns-in-practice.md) | Worked examples for Module 5 topics: RAG prompt design, defensive prompting, evaluation pipelines, and multimodal prompts |

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Read the corresponding module first.** Each example references specific patterns and principles from the curriculum.
2. **Try the prompts yourself.** Copy the prompts and run them against any LLM you have access to (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, or a local model like Ollama).
3. **Compare your results.** LLM outputs are non-deterministic — your results will differ from the examples. Focus on whether the structural patterns produce consistently better outputs, not on exact matches.
