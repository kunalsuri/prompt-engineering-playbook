# Prompt Engineering Labs

> **Runnable experiments** that demonstrate curriculum concepts with real LLM API calls. Each lab is a self-contained Python script — or run them **free in Google Colab** with zero local setup.

## 🚀 Run Free in Google Colab (Recommended)

### Free LLM Providers

The Colab notebooks let you choose a provider at runtime. **No credit card required** for the free options:

| Provider | Free Tier | How to Get a Key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Google Gemini** ⭐ | 15 RPM, 1 M tokens/day | [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| **Groq** | 30 RPM, 14.4 K tokens/min | [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) |
| **OpenAI** (paid) | Pay-per-token | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |

## Run Locally

> **Sandbox policy:** Labs enforce isolated execution. Run them in `.venv` (recommended), `conda`, or Google Colab. Running with system Python outside an isolated environment will exit with a safety error.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- An API key for at least one provider (see table above)

### Setup

```bash
cd learn/labs
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API key(s)
```

## How Labs Work

Each lab script:

1. Defines two or more prompt variants (naive vs. pattern-applied)
2. Sends each variant to the configured LLM API multiple times
3. Collects and scores the outputs
4. Prints a comparison table showing the difference

The labs auto-detect your provider: Google Gemini → Groq → OpenAI (first available key wins). Override with `LLM_MODEL` and `OPENAI_API_BASE` in your `.env`.

## Failure Gallery

Interactive exercises where you **diagnose broken prompts** before reading the solution.

| Case | Anti-Pattern | Core Lesson |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [01 — Kitchen Sink](failure-gallery/01-kitchen-sink/broken-prompt.md) | Doing too much in one prompt | Task decomposition |
| [02 — Stale Context](failure-gallery/02-stale-context/broken-prompt.md) | Relying on out-of-date model knowledge | Grounding / RAG |
| [03 — Injection Vulnerable](failure-gallery/03-injection-vulnerable/broken-prompt.md) | Secrets in system prompt, no override defense | Security & input sanitisation |
| [04 — Ambiguous Format](failure-gallery/04-ambiguous-format/broken-prompt.md) | No output schema for structured data | Constrained output (Lab 5) |
| [05 — Missing Constraints](failure-gallery/05-missing-constraints/broken-prompt.md) | All 4 of 5 prompt components absent | Prompt anatomy (Module 1) |

See [failure-gallery/README.md](failure-gallery/README.md) for the scoring rubric.

## Output Disclaimer

LLM outputs are non-deterministic. Your results will differ from run to run and from model to model. The purpose of these labs is to observe *relative* differences between prompt strategies, not to reproduce exact numbers.
